47 : works, empty function
50 : works, matmul
52 : works
58 : works
62 : lowering error assertion
68 : works, but not lowered to gpu  , iterator_types is not parallel (empty)
80 : works
90 : works
104 : lowering error assertion, has complex type, extract real
106 : lowering error assertion, has complex type. extract img
108 : works, no linalg.generic
